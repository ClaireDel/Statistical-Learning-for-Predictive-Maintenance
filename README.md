In many industries, failure prediction is a consistent topic in predictive maintenance. Airlines are 
particularly interested in predicting equipment failures in advance to enhance the maintenance operations 
and planning of the aircraft engines. Indeed, by knowing which equipment needs maintenance, repair work 
can be better planned. Consequently, this reduces flight delays, losses due to the time engine has spent 
at the ground, the cost of time-based maintenance, and prevents unexpected equipment failures. 
Consulting engine's health and current condition through sensors and telemetry data is assumed to 
promote predictive maintenance by estimating the Time-To-Failure (TTF) or the Remaining Useful Life 
(RUL) of in-service equipment.
The project objective is to enhance the maintenance operations and planning of time-based preventive 
maintenance by applying data science techniques. By exploring the aircraft engineâ€™s historical data, the 
machine learning algorithm can learn the relationship between the sensor values to predict future failures
and make data-driven decisions on its maintenance planning. Based on this analysis, the company will be 
able to estimate engine's time-to-failure and optimize its maintenance operations accordingly. 
This report describes the work and the results about two main objectives. First, predicting the TTF (the 
number of remaining cycles before engine failure) for the engine using regression modelling algorithms, 
secondly, classifying which engine will fail in the analysed time-period by binary classification. All the codes 
will be performed in Python 3, using Jupyter Notebook, and different useful environments.
